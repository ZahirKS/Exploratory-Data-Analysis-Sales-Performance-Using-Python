##  Exploratory Data Analysis: Sales Performance Using Python

The Purpose of this case study was to describe the steps I took to examine a retail dataset. To begin, I performed some tasks like removing missing values from datasets, creating new columns, and changing the data type of columns (to datetime). The subject then shifts to the analysis of exploration data, where we explore questions about our data from a business perspective.

### Key Findings
After thoroughly examining the data, various conclusions were drawn:

* There has been a great significant increase in sales in the company over years despite some shortcomings.
* New York & Los Angeles City made the most order for all product categories.
* The technology category is the most dominant category in the 7 markets that we have.
* Sales & Profit takes a dip during July across all years and the company makes the most sales between November and December.
* The customer segment makes the most profit.
* The shipping cost affects sales as we can see that they are strongly correlated.

From the business angle, based on the findings, I would recommend the following to stakeholders of the company:

* The company should stop selling products that the profit is negative as that is a loss to the company.
* Reduce discounts in cities where we have high discounts but low profits.
* For the company to increase customer satisfaction, the relationship between shipment interval and cost needs to be improved. There also needs to be a yardstick for proximity, distance, quick delivery, and longer delivery times.
* In regions and countries with low sales, the company should increase product marketing and advertising.
